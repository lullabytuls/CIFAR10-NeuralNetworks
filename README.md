CIFAR-10 Neural Networks

CIFAR-10 is a benchmark popular datasets used in machine learning literature for bechmarking different methods. (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

In the implementation, there is full connected neural network that take a 32x32 Cifar-10 image as a 3,072 dimensional input. The network produces 10 outputs each representing one Cifar-10 class. Code trains the network with Cifar-10 training data.
